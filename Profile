Hi, I’m @TiagoViola and I'm passionate about visual effects, 3D and motion graphics, aiming to achieve perfection in every project, implementing strong attention to detail and creative innovation when 
developing elements, components and animations. Committed to expand my capabilities, always with the necessary motivation to acquire new knowledge and working methods in order to improve myself 
every day.
I’m interested in sports, videogames, music, travel, sci-fi and cinema.
I’m currently learning and expanding my 3D skills in Maya and Houdini. 
I’m looking to collaborate on several projects in these areas: 3D, visual effects, motion graphics, graphic design, product design and communication design.
You can reach me at tiagomnviola@gmail.com. I'll be thrilled to hear from you!
